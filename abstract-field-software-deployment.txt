Title: Software Deployment in the Field (Technical Debt and Data-Ops)

Abstract:

In the Earth Observing Laboratory at NCAR, we develop and deploy many
different instruments, for platforms ranging from miniature sondes to
radars and aircraft, to areas all over the world to observe all kinds of
phenomena.  Every field deployment is in fact a custom and very complicated
configuration of systems, software, instruments, and data streams.  Besides
the stories about writing software in some interesting situations, field
projects present some (exciting) challenges for software engineering.  The
concept of technical debt gives an interesting perspective on these
challenges and on the costs incurred while under the pressure of a field
deployment.  Some ideas from dev-ops can be borrowed to help deal with
these costs and to optimize data collection in general, in that the more
automated we can make system deployment, data collection, and data
processing in the field, the more we can mitigate the costs of manual
customization, intervention, and "real-time development".

This talk will present a few approaches to dev-ops and "data-ops" for field
deployments, and frame some questions about how to know which approaches to
use when.  In particular, the talk will describe a python package used for
managing streams of data files for the Integrated Sounding System, and the
ways this package has evolved to test a data-ops idea of continuous data
processing, similar to continuous integration and release for software.
